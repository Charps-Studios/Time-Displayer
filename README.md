In order to be able to use this application you must have python, and have installed tkinter. If you have not installed tkinter you can do this by simply inputting `pip install tkinter` into cmd. Use the 'Time Displayer' shortcut to run the program if you are on Windows. If not you can just run the python file, preferably pythonw.exe and not python.exe.
